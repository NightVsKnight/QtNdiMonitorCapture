// has KVM enabled or not. If you are receiving data from the video source using NDIlib_recv_capture_v2, then
// you will be notified of a potential change of KVM status when that function
// returns NDIlib_frame_type_status_change.

// a double-click operation you would send three messages; the first two would be mouse click messages with
// the third being the mouse release message. It is important that for each click message there must be at
// least one mouse release message or the operating system that you are connected too will continue to
